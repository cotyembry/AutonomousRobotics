This repo will be used to easily grab versions of code for the bot we are making during our Summer 2016 Computer Science Robotics course

# Summer of 2017

# C Language Info

semicolons are needed at the end every statement (like a . [period] is needed to end a sentence in English)

# declaring variables (i.e. creating an defining variables) - they take up a space in memory when created

# integer
int myIntegerVariable = 7;

# float
float myFloatVariable = 2.1;

# character
char* myCharacter = "a";

# string
char* characterString = "abcdefg";







# printing variables to the screen (so we can see their contents)

# printing an integer
printf("this is the integer variable ->%d<-\n", myIntegerVariable);


# printing a float
printf("this is the float variable created above ->%f<-\n", myFloatVariable)


# printing a character
printf("this is the character variable created above ->%c<-\n", myCharacter);


# printing a string
printf("this is the string variable from above ->%s<-\n", characterString);
